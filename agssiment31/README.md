# delete noise
Mean filtering is a simple and easy to implement method of smoothing images. It is often used to reduce noise in images. The mean filter is computed using a convolution. The idea of mean filtering is simply to replace each pixel value in an image with the mean (average) value of its neighbors, including itself. Often a 3√ó3 square kernel is used, although larger kernels (e.g. 5√ó5 squares) can be used for more severe smoothing.


if it's 5*5, make more bluring the image.
